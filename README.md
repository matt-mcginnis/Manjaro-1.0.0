# Manjaro-1.0.0
Set of scripts and files to get up and running after a fresh Manjaro installation.

## Steps for Installation
The bootstrapping for this one is a little wonky so a lot of the steps are manual for now.
1) Run the shell scripts to update and install the packages I like.
2) Refer to the Manual steps documentation for further configuration and installation steps.
